## Introduction

Machine learning is a powerful field with applications in various domains. This repository provides Python implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques. Whether you're interested in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks, or reinforcement learning, you'll find relevant code examples and explanations here.

## Supervised Learning

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple yet powerful technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

### Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes. 

### Bagging

Bagging is an ensemble technique that combines multiple machine learning models to improve predictive accuracy.

### Decision Tree

Decision trees are a popular tool for both classification and regression tasks. 

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-nearest neighbors is a simple and effective algorithm for classification and regression. 

## Unsupervised Learning

### K-Means Clustering

K-means clustering is a widely-used technique for grouping data points into clusters. 

### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering organizes data into a tree-like structure, allowing for in-depth exploration of data relationships. 

### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Gaussian Mixture Models are used for modeling data with multiple Gaussian distributions. 

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used for data compression and feature extraction. 

## Neural Networks

### Perceptron

The perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network, used for binary classification. 

## Reinforcement Learning

### N-Queens

The N-Queens problem is a classic puzzle often used in reinforcement learning, that involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Q-Learning

Q-Learning is a popular reinforcement learning technique, used for solving problems where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
